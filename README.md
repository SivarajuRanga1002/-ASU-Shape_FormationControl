# ASU-Shape_FormationControl
Utilizing the Robotarium Software by GeorgiaTech, A given number of robots are directed to align themselves to form the shape "ASU"

**Concepts Used**

**Swarm Robotics**
This is the foundational concept where a large number of robots operate in coordination. The robots in a swarm share information and work together to complete tasks more efficiently than a single robot could.

**Formation Control**
This technique is crucial for guiding the robots to form the desired "ASU" shape. It involves algorithms that direct the movement of each robot in relation to others, maintaining specific positions and orientations to achieve the overall pattern.

**Barrier Certificates**
These are used to ensure the safety of the robots while they maneuver into formation. Barrier certificates prevent collisions between robots and with obstacles by defining safe operational boundaries within which the robots must remain.

**Robotarium Simulator**
A specific tool used for simulating and visualizing the behavior of the swarm in a controlled environment. This allows for testing and refinement of the algorithms before implementation in real robots.

**Proportional Controllers**
These are employed to fine-tune the positioning of each robot. They adjust the speed and direction of the robots based on the difference between their current position and the desired position, ensuring precise placement in the formation.

**Mathematical Modelling and Analysis**
This involves defining the behavior of each robot and the swarm as a whole using mathematical equations. This modeling considers factors like robot dynamics, sensing, communication capabilities, and environmental properties.

**Simulation and Validation**
After theoretical analysis, simulations are conducted to validate the models and control strategies. This step confirms that the swarm behaves as expected and that the "ASU" shape is formed accurately and efficiently.
